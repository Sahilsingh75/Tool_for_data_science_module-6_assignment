# Tool_for_data_science_module-6_assignment
Final project demonstrating data science skills using Jupyterlite Notebook. Includes Python code for arithmetic operations, data science tools table, and Markdown documentation.
This GitHub repository showcases my final project for a data science course, focusing on using Jupyterlite Notebook for interactive data analysis and presentation. The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in creating and sharing reproducible data science notebooks.

Key Features:

Objective: Create and share a Jupyterlite Notebook via a public GitHub link, illustrating fundamental data science concepts.

Content Overview:

Markdown Cells: Title, introduction, objectives, and documentation of exercises.
Code Cells: Python code for arithmetic operations and conversions (e.g., multiplying integers, converting minutes to hours).
Table of Data Science Tools: Lists three open-source development environments for data science.
Tools Used:

Jupyterlite Notebook: Lightweight, interactive environment for educational purposes.
GitHub: Version control, collaboration, and sharing of the notebook.
Learning Outcomes:

Gain practical experience in Markdown for documentation, Python for data manipulation, and creating informative tables.
Next Steps:

Enhance the notebook with advanced data science techniques, complex visualizations, and additional Python libraries.
Feedback and Contributions:

Welcome feedback and collaboration through GitHub's issue tracking and pull requests.
